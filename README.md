# Background

This project aims to leverage a vast array of data collected from various international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and social impact organizations actively involved in humanitarian and peace-focused initiatives in Myanmar. The project will specifically concentrate on data related to nutrition, food, agriculture, and environmental projects.

> The core objective of this project is to harness the existing data and transform it into an engaging and comprehensive interactive report. The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide valuable insights and facilitate a better understanding of the ongoing efforts in Myanmar regarding nutrition, food security, sustainable agriculture, and environmental conservation. By visualizing the data in an interactive and user-friendly manner, this report intends to empower stakeholders, policymakers, and the public with actionable information.

Visualizations: The report will utilize a range of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, maps, and infographics, to present the data in a visually appealing and easily understandable format. These visual representations will enable users to quickly grasp the information and draw meaningful conclusions.

Interactivity: The interactive nature of the report will allow users to explore the data according to their specific interests and requirements. Users will have the ability to filter the data based on different parameters, compare various projects, and access detailed information by interacting with the visual elements.
